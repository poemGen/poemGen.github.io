 And in front of my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of pride.  <br />
 A fleeting clouds of lights. <br />
 <br />
 One of them is rosy,  <br />
 the other knows antennae.  <br />
 Where  <br />
 is somebody  <br />
 he quips, and when can we see what  <br />
 is going to happen?  <br />
 What we say reflects to  <br />
 wake some other astronaut  <br />
 what a synonym may teach.  <br />
 One of them is electrical, <br />
 <br />
 The other knows calculations.  <br />
 Where is nobody  <br />
 she  <br />
 cries, and when can we see what  <br />
 is  <br />
 going to happen?  <br />
 Towards those horses of yours that wait for me. <br />
