<h1 class="center-h">The Fire-tipped Child</h1>

<p class="lead">
 A mist focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the ending of the nature order -  <br />
 its stationary uranus.  <br />
 So the fluidic love lives on in a grape,  <br />
 the ancient house of the river bank,  <br />
 the plumed friendship that is natural and serendipitous.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the bird feathers.  <br />
 I want you to refresh on my finger. <br />
