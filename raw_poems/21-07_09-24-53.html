<h1 class="center-h">Setting The Eddy In Motion</h1> 
 <br />
<p class="lead">
 Come with me to the secretion of croaks.  <br />
 To seek  <br />
 another land the cleansed banner gave it tiredness.  <br />
 The sweetnes rescues in transforming your eye. <br />
 <br />
 Silvery probes of receptacle,  <br />
 translucent blue seams above a calculating aroma.  <br />
 You are the banana of my insatiable eyelids.  <br />
 Wave of wave of starss in the sky rolling down the sea. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Amid the perfume of the thicket where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream electrifies into computers.  <br />
 If you were not the plum the ancient moon  <br />
 cooks, sprinkling its peach across the heights. <br />
