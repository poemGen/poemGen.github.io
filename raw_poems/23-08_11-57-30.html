 Here I am, a resplendent brain undulated in the divisions of rose. Carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my flute -  <br />
 a tear stained wave day  <br />
 a shady elixir day  <br />
 you are the orange of my calculating  <br />
 heart.  <br />
 Halfway.  <br />
 <br />
 In and out of the silvery the marine and the transparent  <br />
 in my city at afternoon you are like a yellow lake  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I play them. <br />
