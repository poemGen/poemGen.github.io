 Sometimes a piece of the clay  <br />
 mutates like a fragrance of strawberry in my mouth.  <br />
 Of a blood colored man that discovers serenities.  <br />
 Magnifying the root of her salt full of decency.  <br />
 On what smothered pigeon holes reconciled with clay? <br />
 <br />
 With its frightened flutter conversations of foliages, the recitation  <br />
 of sun rises we call romantic law.  <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are reflected in my finger of cork.  <br />
 You, who is like a lamprey ostrich among the re-covering of many lady. <br />
