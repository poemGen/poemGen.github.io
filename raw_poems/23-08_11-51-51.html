<h1 class="center-h">Conducting Blood-stained Nostalgia</h1>

<p class="lead">
 There are many coals inside lashed events.  <br />
 It travels like a forest behind the time.  <br />
 Once there was a negligent elder who  <br />
 lighted at parties, sitting in a loop, among saxophones.  <br />
 My heart moves from being chaotic to being esoteric. <br />
 <br />
 Shut out and shut out like a snow.  <br />
 And you crushed in the beligerance and rejoiced a harassing vagabond.  <br />
 And the kiss to its utensil  <br />
 and among the elixirs the fleeting one  <br />
 the cousin covered with unguessed serenity. <br />
