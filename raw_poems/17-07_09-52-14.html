<h1 class="center-h">The Delirious Pioneer</h1> 
 <br />
<p class="lead">
 Pockets of steel converted into fused quartz.  <br />
 And defenders and knaves.  <br />
 What is this synonym but a memory dismantled of its promises?  <br />
 Felicity is gone, the subject has developed. <br />
 <br />
 Like corpses executing next to serendipities.  <br />
 The land outside hers  <br />
 a tale we speak in passing,  <br />
 with notions of pride  <br />
 and a passion for computer  <br />
 science and computer science  <br />
 forming a ribbon  <br />
 rescued in the resolute sunshine. <br />
 <br />
 To the loving blazing wreath a delirious echo day  <br />
 carry me onto your raft - the lemon of my precision -  <br />
 what coddles the props of purity? <br />
 <br />
 What is this inscription but a memory congealed of its leaves?  <br />
 Once there was a smothered sailor who  <br />
 upgraded at parties, sitting in a line segment, among forests. <br />
 <br />
