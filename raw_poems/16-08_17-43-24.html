<p class="lead">
 A current of thick flint  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and inherits.  <br />
 An odor has magnified behind the lake,  <br />
 a mixture of jackal and body, a responding  <br />
 stars in the sky that brings  <br />
 sorrow.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the lava  <br />
 bristles like a flint in my eyelids. <br />
 <br />
 Where veins meet  <br />
 propellers meet, inside and inside and the sound  <br />
 of roosters, to reach out and mingle in anger.  <br />
 One of the depths of my toe - your magnifying  <br />
 stills your handsome regard as though it were clay.  <br />
 And so that its whispers will gnaw your brow.  <br />
 You are the banana of my ghostly eyelids. <br />
 <br />
 There are no pamphlets but inevitable cycles of serenity and sand-colored  <br />
 fountains of rosy demonic metal. <br />
