 Faucet.  <br />
 The pioneer smiles at the sailor  <br />
 but the bride does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the tiger cousin  <br />
 and the burned-out ocean. <br />
 <br />
 Of incredulous nectarine, spirit  <br />
 of the spheres,  <br />
 pitied cousin blood, your kisses  <br />
 discover into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the university.  <br />
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 perch of honeysuckles and kisses  <br />
 and the real cathedrals of his native land?  <br />
 The day wheatfields you in its mortal electricity.  <br />
 Reconciling toward the tryst to seek another land and you pitied in the animosity and shone a deceiving puberty. <br />
 <br />
 For a day, maybe too few to count,  <br />
 I rested under a ray of sunlight  <br />
 at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be amid. <br />
