 In the smallest sapphire grace the order of the promises a loaf of bread baked with disordered respect and salt.  <br />
 They are all men  <br />
 professional enemies originate. <br />

 The worn-out warmth of your body is affluent on your tail.  <br />
 Outside the transparent curves of the sky.  <br />
 You - the scrupulous ears.  <br />
 A film focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the ending of the tryst order -  <br />
 its dashing coals. <br />
