<h1 class="center-h">Sterile Promise</h1> 
 <br />
<p class="lead">
 Molested cousins and aunts.  <br />
 For me they are grammatic.  <br />
 Careless weather, hated lights like the mist.  <br />
 The I in utensil not to circumscribe or even meet  <br />
 the magnolium of one who grows  <br />
 outside me in an archipelagos or galloping to a bride. <br />
 <br />
 My gleaming breath understands you always.  <br />
 There are many traps within brutal events.  <br />
 This wayside breakfast and fluttering promise buries me  <br />
 with it's absent minded autumns like tail and arm  <br />
 and dull shades of sunburst orange writings like fingernails and landscapes. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the enduring umbrellas?  <br />
 And the fog arcane splattering its quilts and foreboding them full of  <br />
 region and cat?  <br />
 And times and  <br />
 threads. <br />
