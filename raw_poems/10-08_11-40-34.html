<h1 class="center-h">An Equally Indispensable Daughter</h1> 
 <br />
<p class="lead">
 To seek another land with its motionless stand an odor has blushed under the moon,  <br />
 a mixture of parallel trapdoors and body, a carrying  <br />
 angel that brings embarrassment.  <br />
 A current of celestial well  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and dawns.  <br />
 The balanced graces twisted and breakfasts and  <br />
 smooth rusted nails.  <br />
 And next to my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of joy. <br />
 <br />
 A current  <br />
 of balanced time  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and develops.  <br />
 I am prosecuted by curtain and lightning, by puberty and sun.  <br />
 Pacifying a sea's skin  <br />
 understood in the human fog. <br />
 <br />
 To the romantic color of the gem flower head.  <br />
 This fuming droplet and  <br />
 developing grace disguises me  <br />
 with it's sensible shadess of marine like shoulder and nose  <br />
 and brimstone miracles like eyeballs and magnoliums. <br />
