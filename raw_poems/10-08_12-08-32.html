<h1 class="center-h">Proof Of Poetic Abstraction</h1> 
 <br />
<p class="lead">
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are gathered in my mouth of cork.  <br />
 Invade me and let my substance preserve. <br />
 <br />
 They are all fishermen  <br />
 professional pamphlets in whose delicate drops originate.  <br />
 The breakfast plan that has everyone wet-winged.  <br />
 The order of the hooves I want you to hear on my leg.  <br />
 I stayed played and green  <br />
 inside the boulevard. <br />
 <br />
 Daughter of the depths of my toe - your blushing  <br />
 stills your wide regard as though it were ice.  <br />
 Yellow corruptions of blade,  <br />
 burnt umber seams above a dead river.  <br />
 Like stains erupting outside windows. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
With its harsh reflect a transparent thread grows. <br />
