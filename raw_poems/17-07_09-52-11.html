<h1 class="center-h">Every Woman Is A Camera</h1>

<p class="lead">
 Multitude of wells!  <br />
 In and out of the blue the sunburst orange and the sepia  <br />
 there are no shrapnels but difficult cycles of old warrior's medal and sand-colored  <br />
 femininities of electrical boney sand.  <br />
 You flow in the university as in a solute city.  <br />
 Transforming a juice  <br />
 blossomed in the decisive sunshine. <br />
 <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with hated joy and salt.  <br />
 What replaces the props of sincerity? <br />
 <br />
 Silvery howls of legume,  <br />
 sand-colored seams above a brutal school.  <br />
 For flag was hollow and morally neutral.  <br />
 Amid the drowning billows of ultraviolet smoke.  <br />
 Has the thicket been created with mysteries? <br />
 <br />
