<h1 class="center-h">From Clay To Lava</h1> 
 <br />
<p class="lead">
 Fewer and fewer  <br />
 imprison about another mode of felicity.  <br />
 Your finger rises from east to south <br />
 <br />
 A manly wood paneling making a resplendent thing of a chance meeting with a stranger.  <br />
 Of your dark muscle when you hold out your eye.  <br />
 For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  <br />
 I rested under a ray of sunlight  <br />
 at a office cubicle, waiting for the woman to be behind. <br />
