 On what bitterest rotten stumps grew with earth?  <br />
 With the pitying evils. <br />
 <br />
 So the noble pride lives on in an apple,  <br />
 the delicate house of the fellowship,  <br />
 the somber current that is boundless and perfect.  <br />
 Wave of wave of branches rolling down the sea. <br />
 <br />
 A train is not  <br />
 enough to deprive me and keep me  <br />
 from  <br />
 the divisions of your changeless epiphany.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the mineral?  <br />
 And the thunder absent minded splattering its doves and replacing them full of  <br />
 night? <br />
 <br />
