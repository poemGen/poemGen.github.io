 They are all people  <br />
 professional explications in whose domestic horses originate. <br />
 <br />
 Inherit on the masks that wait for you  <br />
 dismantling the molested chairs, shattering the doors.  <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are perched in my hips of cork.  <br />
 Aunt of the depths of my foot - your mixing  <br />
 stills your delicious regard as though it were water. <br />
 <br />
 Some perch but I build your brick like well.  <br />
 Come with me to the dust of separations.  <br />
 The heights next to hers  <br />
 a story we tell in passing,  <br />
 with notions of love  <br />
 and a passion for journalism and oceanography <br />
 <br />
