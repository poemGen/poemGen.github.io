<h1 class="center-h">From What Are Lemons Shone</h1>

<p class="lead">
 The eager ribbon  <br />
 gave it honor.  <br />
 In the face of so many utensils to animosity.  <br />
 Fewer and fewer  <br />
 gnaw about another mode  <br />
 of joy.  <br />
 Dedicated and then refreshed in  <br />
 the university. <br />
 <br />
 My manly mouth dawns you always.  <br />
 Carry me onto your vessel - the mango of my echo -  <br />
 once there was a smothered daughter who  <br />
 stood at parties, sitting in a square, among warmths. <br />
