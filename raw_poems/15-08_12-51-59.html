<p class="lead">
 You say, what is the fellowship waiting for in its yellow aroma?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for momentum like you.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the fire  <br />
 decays like a necklace in my leg.  <br />
 Our new bridge, our warm flower lines.  <br />
 Your telegraph is a moon filled with neon cluster. <br />
 <br />
 Like vagabonds compounding amid stones.  <br />
 And the stone to its knave  <br />
 and among the flutes the wonderful one  <br />
 the woman covered with cordial energy.  <br />
 One of them is infinite,  <br />
 the other knows antennae.  <br />
 Where is nobody  <br />
 he cries, and when can we see what  <br />
 is going to happen? <br />
 <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with shaken joy and salt.  <br />
 In and out of the opaque sunburst orange <br />
 <br />
 <br />
As soon as the incoming clusters  <br />
 gives the slightest indication. <br />
