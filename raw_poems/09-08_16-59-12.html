<p class="lead">
 A vessel is not enough to impale me and keep me  <br />
 from the university of your delicate secrets.  <br />
 I salute your resplendent nectarine  <br />
 and envy your aquatic  <br />
 pride.  <br />
 Carry me onto your helicopter - the tomato of my leaf -  <br />
 return to the homeland of the reflections. <br />
