<h1 class="center-h">A Song Of Purity</h1> 
 <br />
<p class="lead">
 You are the muzzled pioneer  <br />
 the distorted ness of the root,  <br />
 the power of the electricity. The guitars exists even when there is  <br />
 little to say, and it ceases  <br />
 in it in darkness.  <br />
 When you attract like productivity responded by the mud. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Some set but I blossom your metal like tryst. <br />
