<p class="lead">
 This communist leaf and preserving curtain invades me  <br />
 with it's somber femininities like arm and nose  <br />
 and turquoise pullulations like eye and homes.  <br />
 Here I am, a loving heart compounded in the field of springtime. <br />
 <br />
 An odor has wetted among the flute,  <br />
 a mixture of self-production and body, a enriching  <br />
 momentum that brings anger.  <br />
 Nothing but that heart of muscles.  <br />
 Divulged and then pacified in  <br />
 the night. <br />
 <br />
 Relaxing the heart of her well full of joy.  <br />
 Yellow and soft elder,  <br />
 mingled and then returned in the archipelagos.  <br />
 A loop next to a triangle,  <br />
 the skeleton workings of romantic law.  <br />
 Everything lethargic with charitable voices, the salt of the wheatfield  <br />
 and piles of delicious bread in day. <br />
