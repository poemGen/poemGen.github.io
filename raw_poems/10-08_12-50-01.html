<h1 class="center-h">I Have Gone Loving</h1> 
 <br />
<p class="lead">
 My heart is filled with joy like a paper-mache movie.  <br />
 How wetting is the round violence and it's decisive errors?  <br />
 Purity is gone, the subject has blushed.  <br />
 There are no daggers but sticky cycles of hoove and yellow  <br />
 echoes of real browbeaten sand. <br />
 <br />
 Be guided by the enduring love's coat. The harsh pheasant continues inside the electrical vagabonds. <br />
