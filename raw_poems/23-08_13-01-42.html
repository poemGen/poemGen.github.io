 Circumscribed  <br />
 and then excited in the jungle.  <br />
 So the humble love lives on in a lemon,  <br />
 the vertical house of the candle,  <br />
 the mineral femininity that is humble and full. <br />
 <br />
 Around the area I like to reflect like a dry affection.  <br />
 Conversations of currents, the recitation  <br />
 of momenta we call poetic door. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
All laminated signs become conglomerates.  <br />
 Like the fractious brick of echoes they are all men  <br />
 professional scandalmongerings in whose celestial necklaces originate.  <br />
 And you buried in the animosity and mixed a overflowing cleft.  <br />
 I was without doubt the sailor  <br />
 there in the motionless sea.  <br />
 When it looked me with its nocturnal hoove eyes  <br />
 it had neither mouth nor lip  <br />
 but ceramic splendors on its sides. <br />
